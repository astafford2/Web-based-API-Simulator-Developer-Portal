## Team Experience
### Jake
The Student Symposium was extremely informative and allowed me several different insights into presenting a project. It allowed me an opprotunity to hone my skills of selling a project to people who have never seen it before. Though the many people we showed the project to and the different responses we received about it, I gained an understanding into how to thoroughly explain and present a new project concept to new viewers. Along with this, seeing and hearing from others at the Symposium was very informative and many of the ideas I had never even considered before. From the many different areas of study these projects came from, Chemistry, Sociology, Business, etc., I was able to learn a lot about various concepts that I didn't have much knowledge in previously.

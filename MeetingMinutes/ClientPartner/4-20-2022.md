## Topics Discussed

    <li>Discussed the different problems with the software currently that we should make Accutech aware of
    <li>Discussed the transfer process and the steps we need to take beforehand
    <li>Discussed possible networking opprotunities with Cam and Ryland in the future
</ul>

## Things Clarified/Completed
<ul>
    <li>Created a markdown file "Accutech.md" that documents the features that either need work or were not completed for one reason or another and included it in our BitBucket repository
    <li>Clarified that the transfer would require minimal to no work from us or Cam and Ryland as Accutech already owns the BitBucket repository
    <li>Per Cam and Ryland's request, we added our app's documentation to the BitBucket repo (along with Accutech.md) in a designated documentation folder
    <li>Created a release in both our Github repository and our BitBucket repository called "SignOff"
    <li>Clarified that we can use Cam and Ryland's name for references on job applications
    <li>Ryland sent us a link to Accutech's job board so that those within the group that wish to work for Accutech after graduation are able to apply
</ul>

### - Administration Page 

On the administration page, the general functioning currently set up for this page is adding a parameter. On the page, there is an object selection bar that allows you to select an object. To use the add parameter button, the user must choose "example object one" in the selection bar. When you click the add parameter button, a modal will display requesting user input. The user can then fill in the information for the modal, including the parameter name, description, type through the selection bar, and say whether it is is required or not through the checkbox. The user can click outside of the modal to close it, or they can fill out the basic information for the parameter and click the save button to close it and save the parameter information. The modal will not close unless the parameter has a name and a parameter type is selected. Not filling this out will cause the save button in the modal to be disabled. The general parameter information also is added to the table of the administration page.

# Web-based-API-Simulator-Developer-Portal
## Summary

For our project we have been tasked to construct a user friendly and more comprehensive Cheetah developer portal that will contain a comprehensive library of documentation of each API endpoint. The information on this developer portal will allow clients and software developers to discover the capabilities of the API. It will also be a space to allow developers to test the functionality of the API with live parameters and responses.

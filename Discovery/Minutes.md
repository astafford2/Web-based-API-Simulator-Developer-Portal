### High-level requirements for the project:
Home/marketing page; Console/sandbox page; Code sample/workflow page; where page will be served; details on connecting to Cheetah database; 
Accutech tech stack; 1st iteration thoughts

## Things Clarified
<strong>Home/marketing page:</strong> team was given full reign on creative freedom for this public facing page, taking inspiration from other API dev portals;<br>
<strong>Console/sandbox page:</strong> needs documentation on API capabilities/functions, split into object sections, taking info from swagger and making more user friendly/less clunky,
sandbox able to test API calls with live parameters and responses, this page will be protected behind login;<br>
<strong>Code sample page:</strong> needs documentation on simple workflows for developers, common processes to be referenced, will also be protected behind login;<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> Accutech/Cheetah working in financial means security is serious, need a login/authentication page for pages non-public facing;<br>
<strong>Serving:</strong> for the scope of the capstone project, just needs to serve locally for dev work;<br>
<strong>Tech stack:</strong> .NET/C# for back-end work, Vue.js for front-end work;<br><br>
